Exercise Steps:

    Create a simple "Hello World" C++ application.
    Write a Dockerfile with two stages:
        Build Stage: Use a base image with all the necessary build tools (e.g., gcc), add your source code, and compile it.
        Final Stage: Start with a clean, minimal base image. Copy only the compiled binary from the build stage.
    Build the Docker image and run a container to test it.


After steps:

    I didn't know that if you compile statically a program all the dependencies will be within the binary file.
    clang++ -static ...

    Dockerfile.mono it does build an image of 8.97 MB.
    Dockerfile.stage it does build an image of 512 MB.
