Before the Exercise:

    FastAPI applications, especially when using Pydantic or other libraries, might require compilation steps for dependencies.
    The build environment (with compilers and build tools) is typically much larger than the runtime environment.

Errors:

    uvicorn tries to look up in app subdir, erase app part:
    
        - CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "80"]
        + CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "80"]
