I have to search for a needle string in a haystack string. I will only use iterators.

I have to search through the haystack string untill I find an equal string, the from that position
I have to compare both needle and haystack[idx], if they endup being equal, I have to return the index of
needle in haystack, otherwise start continue with the algorithm.
